# why i chose streamlit

i've been wanting to revamp my personal website for a while now. 

years ago, i spent *quite* some time designing and building this [High Sierra Mac desktop-themed site](winnay.com). 

over the years, however, my view on the function of a personal site changed dramatically. i started admiring the minimalistic HTML static sites, in which text regained its status as the first class citizen of the browser. i considered using substack, but that would surrender too much authority over visual and content customization. 

...so i decided to run this site with streamlit bc streamlit

1. was easy to get it off the ground, with streamlit components and cloud
2. supports markdown
3. is ML-centric; i want to future-proof my website such that it will be easy to integrate AI features into it
4. supports most python functionalities. data visualisation and graphics can be seamlessly integrated in the future 
5. is free and open-source!
